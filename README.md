This was the final project for Object Oriented Programming course at AGH University of Krakow.

Final product of this project was a graphical apllication (JavaFX) that simulates a simplified version of figthing for survival. Animals are randomly walking around the map and eating grass to gain energy. They can reproduce, but without any energy left they die.

User can set many parameters to try different scenarios of a simulation. There is a possibility to create custom configuration and save it to csv file. Additionally user can save stats (such number of animals or average energy on a given day) of chosen simulation to csv file where every line contains stats from one day.

User can pause a simulation and choose one animal to follow and see its personal stats.
